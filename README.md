A hex editor and tone editing tool for Casio keyboards. Currently targets CT-X3000 & CT-X5000.

## Windows

A pre-built windows executable may be downloaded from here. Extract from the zip file. The first time you run it, Windows security may ask if you really want to run it: click "More Info" and "Run Anyway".

## Linux

A pre-built executable may be downloaded from here for Linux kernel versions from 4.15 or later (e.g. Ubuntu 18.04 or later). Extract from the zip file and run ```sudo chmod +x tyrant```.

## From source

You can also just clone or download this Github repository and run it by calling ```python run.py```. That works for Windows, all versions of Linux, and maybe even Mac OS. There are some prerequisites to install which are detailed [here](Prequisites.md).
